#  StraitJacket
StraitJacket is an object oriented autolayout solution designed to do more with less.

## Why
### It will keep devs from hurting themselves
- No xibs or storyboards
- No confusing amalgamations of stackviews and stackview related bugs
- Much faster to write and less error prone than anchor based code and similar libraries
- Much higher skimmability and code density
- Built on top of auto layout

## How it works
### It's just swift code

Constraints are created using the `Restraint` object.  Its methods are capable of creating many constraints at once and are all chainable.  The root view that `Restraint` is init'd with holds the created constraints. Items must be added to the root view for constraints to be built.  The `addItems:` method can be used to add multiple items for convenience.

```swift
let aRestraint = Restraint(self.view)
    .addItems([titleLabel, usernameTextField, passwordTextField, confirmButton])
    .chainVertically([titleLabel, Space(60).withId("space"), usernameTextField, passwordTextField, confirmButton],
                     in: self.view.layoutMarginsGuide)
```

Constraints are not active upon creation. Don't forget to activate the `Restraint`.  

```swift
aRestraint.activate()
```

Constraints can be created with their respective `withId:` methods and priorities can also be added to individual constraints using the respective `withPriority:` methods.  Constraints can be referred to by id.

```swift
let spaceConstraint = aRestraint.constraintWithId("space")
// do something with the constraint
```

### Restraints are composable
```swift
let restraint1A = Restraint(someView)
// make some constraints
let restraint1B = Restraint(someView)
// make some other constraints
let restraint1 = Restraint(someView, subRestraints: [restraint1A, restraint1B])
restraint1.activate()
// activating restraint1 also activates restraint1A and restraint1B
```
### It can use any NSLayoutConstraint
```swift
let aConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint = // some constraint
aRestraint.addConstraints([aConstraint])
```
